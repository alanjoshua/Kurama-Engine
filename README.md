# Kurama Engine

<p> This project is a work-in-progress and so documentation is extremely lax right now. This is just something I am using to learn openGL/game engine design with, and so the API is messy at places and wasn't made with the intention of being a game engine to be used by other people (though feel free to mess around with it). Once I am satisfied with the features built into it, I'll work one cleaning up the API :) </p>
